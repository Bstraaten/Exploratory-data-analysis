# Exploratory-data-analysis

This repository contains the files for the peer graded asignment course project 1 of Coursera's exploratory data analysis course.

You'll find 8 files, 4 R scripts and 4 PNG files containing the graphs. The 4 script will load the data from your working directory, make some transformations and produce the graphs.

Please make sure the data is in your working directory named "household_power_consumption.txt".

Furthermore, please be kind on non-Englisch day names since my machine is set in a different language. Thank you :)
